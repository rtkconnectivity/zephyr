  RTL87X2G KSCAN.

  The RTL87X2G KSCAN should be used with an external kscan matrix.
  There is a total of 12 rows and 20 columns. You can assign any available pins to row or colunm by pinctrl.
  The rows and columns need to be indexed starting from 0.

  Example of devicetree configuration.

  &kscan {
        pinctrl-0 = <&kscan_default>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        row-size = <2>;
        col-size = <2>;
        debounce-time-ms = <10>;
        scan-time-ms = <10>;
        release-time-ms = <10>;
        scan-debounce-cnt = <1>;
        status = "okay";
    };

    &pinctrl {
        kscan_default: kscan_default {
            group1 {
              psels = <RTL87X2G_PSEL(KEY_COL_0, P0_6, DIR_OUT, DRV_LOW, PULL_NONE)>,
              <RTL87X2G_PSEL(KEY_COL_1, P0_7, DIR_OUT, DRV_LOW, PULL_NONE)>;
            };
            group2 {
              psels = <RTL87X2G_PSEL(KEY_ROW_0, P2_4, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_UP)>,
              <RTL87X2G_PSEL(KEY_ROW_1, P2_5, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_UP)>;
              bias-pull-strong;
            };
        };
