  RTL87X2G ADC.
  The RTL87X2G ADC has 8 channels. Pinctrl must be configured as "SW_MODE" while using ADC.
  P2_0 to P2_7 could be configured as ADC sampling pins, corresponding to ADC channel 0 to 7.

  Example of devicetree configuration.

  &adc {
    pinctrl-0 = <&adc_default>;
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    status = "okay";
    channel@0 {
        reg = <0>;
        zephyr,gain = "ADC_GAIN_1";
        zephyr,reference = "ADC_REF_INTERNAL";
        zephyr,acquisition-time = <ADC_ACQ_TIME_DEFAULT>;
        zephyr,resolution = <12>;
    };

    channel@1 {
        reg = <1>;
        zephyr,gain = "ADC_GAIN_1";
        zephyr,reference = "ADC_REF_INTERNAL";
        zephyr,acquisition-time = <ADC_ACQ_TIME_DEFAULT>;
        zephyr,resolution = <12>;
    };
  };

  &pinctrl {
    adc_default: adc_default {
        group1 {
            psels = <RTL87X2G_PSEL(SW_MODE, P2_0, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_DOWN)>,
            <RTL87X2G_PSEL(SW_MODE, P2_1, DIR_IN, DRV_LOW, PULL_DOWN)>;
        };
    };
  };

      Config adc channels as bypass mode or divide mode.
      In "divide mode" the ADC range is 0 to 3.3V.
      In "bypass mode" the ADC range is 0 to 0.9V.
