Connections and IOs
===================

Please refer to `RTL8752H EVB Interfaces Distribution`_ which has detailed information about board interfaces.

System Clock
============
The RTL8752H features a 40MHz crystal oscillation circuit that is integrated within the device, ensuring a reliable and consistent system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The RTL8752H series has 3 UARTs. By default, UART2 is configured for the console and log output.

LED
===========

- LED = P4_3
- RGB LED

  - LED_R = P4_1
  - LED_G = P4_2
  - LED_B = P4_0

Buttons
===========

- RESET
- SW1 = P2_4

Essential Images
-------------------

Before running a Zephyr application on the RTL8752H, there are some essential images that need to be programmed into the board firstly. You can fetch and download these images following the instructions in the "Burn essential images" section of `rtkconnectivity`_.

.. note::
   To download these images, MP Tool (for Windows) and MPCli Tool (for Windows/MAC/Linux) developed by Realtek are recommended. These tools use UART(TX P3_0, RX P3_1) to establish a connection with the device.

   For MP Tool / MPCli Tool downloading and usage details, please refer to:
     - `MP Tool Guide`_
     - `MPCli Tool Guide`_

Programming
===========

To flash a Zephyr application image, the `west flash` command with J-Link is supported. For devices not yet included in the J-Link support list, additional configuration steps are required. Please refer to `JLink Configuration`_ for detailed instructions. Additionally, the MP Tool / MPCli Tool, as mentioned in the `Essential Images` section, is also available.

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
    :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
    :board: rtl8752h_dongle
    :goals: build flash

To visualizing the console log:

#. Connect the UART:

    - UART2 TX/RX: P3_0/P3_1

#. Open a serial communication tool that you are familiar with:

    - Set the baudrate to 2000000.

#. Press the reset button:

    - You should see “Hello World! rtl8752h_dongle” in your terminal.

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: rtl8752h_dongle
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
